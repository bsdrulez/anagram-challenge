=== Description of the challenge ===
Two words are anagrams of one another if their letters can be rearranged to form the other word. Given a string, split it into two contiguous substrings of equal length. Determine the minimum number of characters to change to make the two substrings into anagrams of one another.

=== Example ===
s = abccde
Break s into two parts: 'abc' and 'cde'. Note that all letters have been used, the substrings are contiguous and their lengths are equal. Now you can change 'a' and 'b' in the first substring to 'd' and 'e' to have 'dec' and 'cde' which are anagrams. Two changes were necessary.

Write an anagram function with the following parameters: 
	String strParam: a string 
Returns
	int: the minimum number of characters to change or -1


Sample Input and Output
	aaabbb ? 3
	aAabab ? 2
	ab ? 1
	abc ? -1
	mnop ? 2
	xyyx ? 0
	xaxbbbxx ? 1
	bbxxxaxb ? 1

=== Solution ===
The solution of the challenge has been implemented in NumberOfCharsToBeChangedForHalfAnagram.py and can be invoked like this:
   echo "abccab" | python3 NumberOfCharsToBeChangedForHalfAnagram.py
or the tests can be run as:
   python3 tests.py
